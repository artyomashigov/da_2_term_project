# Literacy rate regression analysis

## Introduction
Education is fundamental to societal progress, with literacy rates being a key indicator of a society's educational health. This study investigates
the relationship between the student-teacher ratio and literacy rates among adults. The student-teacher ratio is a critical indicator of
educational quality, with lower ratios potentially leading to higher literacy due to more individualized attention.<br>

This analysis extends beyond the student-teacher ratio to include factors like government expenditure on education, GDP per capita,primary
education completion rate, and average years of schooling. These variables are considered to unravel the specific impact of student-teacher
ratios from the broader socio-economic context.<br>

The goal is to determine the extent to which the student-teacher ratio, among these factors, influences literacy rates.
